    <p class="c2">The judiciary of India (ISO: Bhārata kī Nyāyapālikā) is the system of courts that interpret and apply the law in the Republic of India. India uses a common law system, first introduced by the British East India Company and with influence from other colonial powers and Indian princely states, as well as practices from ancient and medieval times.[3][4][5] The Constitution of India provides concept for a single and unified judiciary in India.

        The Indian judicial system is managed and administrated by officers. Judges of Subordinate Judiciaries are appointed by the governor on recommendation by the High Court. Judges of the High Courts and Supreme Court are appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of a collegium.
        
        The judicial system is structured in three levels with subsidiary parts. The Supreme Court, also known as the Apex Court, is the top court and the ultimate appellate court in India. The Chief Justice of India leads that court. High Courts are the top judicial bodies in individual states, controlled and managed by state Chief Justices. Below the High Courts are District Courts, also known as subordinate courts, that are controlled and managed by District and Sessions Judges. The lower subordinate courts are Civil Court and the District Munsif Court, headed by a Sub-Judge. The higher subordinate court, Criminal Court, is headed by Chief Judicial/Metropolitan Magistrate at top and followed by ACJM /ACMM and JM/MM[clarification needed] at the lower level.
        
        The Executive and Revenue Courts are managed by the state government through the district magistrate or other executive magistrates. Although the executive courts are not part of the judiciary, various provisions and judgements empower the High Courts and Session Judges to inspect or direct their operation.
        
        The Ministry of Law and Justice at the Union level is responsible for raising issues before Parliament relating to the judiciary. It has jurisdiction to deal with the issues of any court. It also deals with the appointment of Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court. At the state level, the law departments of the states deal with issues regarding the High Court and the Subordinate Courts.
        
        The Constitution and the Judiciary
        The Indian Constitution empowers the Judiciary to act as the Guardian of the Law. A number of provisions deal with the Judiciary's role, power, function, and officer appointments. The major provisions are:
        
        Part V - Chapter IV - Union Judiciary i.e., Supreme Court - appointment and removal, role and function
        Part VI - Chapter V - High Court - appointment and removal, role and function
        Part VI - Chapter VI- Subordinate Courts - appointment and removal, role and function
        Article 50 - Independence of Judiciary - separates judiciary from executive branch
        Other provisions appear under parts and articles that deal with the court's responsibilities.
        The judiciary acts as the arbiter on legal matters. The Inner Conflict of Constitutionalism: Judicial Review and the 'Basic Structure' – India's Living Constitution: Constitution, acts as its watchdog by calling for scrutiny any act of the legislature or the executive from overstepping bounds set for them by the Constitution.[6] It acts as a guardian in protecting the fundamental rights of the people, as enshrined in the Constitution, from infringement by any organ of the state. It also balances the conflicting exercise of power between the centre and a state or among states.
        
        The judiciary is expected to remain unaffected by pressures exerted by other branches of government, citizens or interest groups. Independence of the judiciary is a basic and inalienable feature of the Constitution,[7][8][9] One such protection is that no minister can suggest a name to the President,[10][11] who ultimately appoints judges from a list recommended by the collegium of the judiciary. Judges of the Supreme Court or a High Court cannot be removed from office once appointed, unless a two-thirds majority of members of any of the Houses of the Parliament back the move on grounds of misconduct or incapacity.[12][13] A person who has been a judge of a court is barred from practising in the jurisdiction of that court[</p>
